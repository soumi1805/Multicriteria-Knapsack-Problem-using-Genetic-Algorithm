# Multicriteria-Knapsack-Problem-using-Genetic-Algorithm
Knapsack problem represents all those practical problems around us where user need to
choose the optimal combination from a large number of options available.

However, Instead of one objective such as maximizing the monetary profit ,there could be
environmental or social concerns as well. In short there could be several objectives with
multiple constraints. This is Multicriteria Knapsack Problem.

The example used here is:
A factory must not produce more than 12 kilograms of pollutants.

Now the Factory wants to buy machine with maximize productivity while minimizing the pollution rate.

While doing this they must ensure they can buy as many as machines possible.Factory's budget (10 Crore)
should be taken as a factor also.
Thw fields in the inventory file represents Item no.,Productivity,Pollution and cost respectively.
